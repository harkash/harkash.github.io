excerpt: 'Traditionally, the sliding window based activity recognition
chain (ARC) has been dominating practical applications,
in which features are carefully optimized towards scenario
specifics. Recently, end-to-end, deep learning methods, that
do not discriminate between representation learning and
classifier optimization, have become very popular also for
HAR using wearables, promising "out-of-the-box" modeling
with superior recognition capabilities. In this paper, we revisit
and analyze specifically the role feature representations
play in HAR using wearables. In a systematic exploration we
evaluate eight different feature extraction methods, including
conventional heuristics and recent representation learning
methods, and assess their capabilities for effective activity
recognition on five benchmarks. Optimized feature learning
integrated into the conventional ARC leads to comparable if
not better recognition results as if using end-to-end learning
methods, while at the same time offering practitioners
more flexibility to optimize their systems towards specifics
of wearables and their constraints and limitations.'
