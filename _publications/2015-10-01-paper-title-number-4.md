## Abstract
This paper describes the speaker verification (SV) system submitted to the NIST 2016 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE)
challenge by Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG) under the fixed training condition task. Various SV systems are
developed following the idea-level collaboration with two other Indian institutions. Unlike the previous SREs, this time 
the focus was on developing SV system using non-target language speech data and a small amount unlabeled data from target 
language/dialects. For addressing these novel challenges, we tried exploring the fusion of systems created using different 
features, data conditioning, and classifiers. On NIST 2016 SRE evaluation data, the presented fused system resulted in 
actual detection cost function (actDCF) and equal error rate (EER) of 0.81 and 12.91%, respectively. Post-evaluation, we 
explored a recently proposed pairwise support vector machine classifier and applied adaptive S-norm to the decision scores 
before fusion. With these changes, the final system achieves the actDCF and EER of 0.67 and 11.63%, respectively.
