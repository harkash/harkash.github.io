excerpt: 'This paper describes the speaker verification (SV) system sub-
mitted to the NIST 2016 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE)
challenge by Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG)
under the fixed training condition task. Various SV systems are
developed following the idea-level collaboration with two other
Indian institutions. Unlike the previous SREs, this time the fo-
cus was on developing SV system using non-target language
speech data and a small amount unlabeled data from target lan-
guage/dialects. For addressing these novel challenges, we tried
exploring the fusion of systems created using different features,
data conditioning, and classifiers. On NIST 2016 SRE evalu-
ation data, the presented fused system resulted in actual detec-
tion cost function (actDCF) and equal error rate (EER) of 0.81
and 12.91%, respectively. Post-evaluation, we explored a re-
cently proposed pairwise support vector machine classifier and
applied adaptive S-norm to the decision scores before fusion.
With these changes, the final system achieves the actDCF and
EER of 0.67 and 11.63%, respectively.'
