title: "Factor Analysis Methods For Joint Speaker Verification and Spoof Detection"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/factor_analysis_methods
excerpt: 'The performance of a speaker verification system is severely de-
graded by spoofing attacks generated from artificial speech synthe-
sizers. Recently, several approaches have been proposed for classi-
fying natural and synthetic speech (spoof detection) which can be
used in conjunction with a speaker verification system. In this paper,
we attempt to develop a joint modelling approach which can detect
the presence of spoofing attacks while also performing the speaker
verification task. We propose a factor modelling approach where
the spoof variability subspace and the speaker variability subspace
are jointly trained. The lower dimensional projections in these sub-
spaces are used for speaker verification as well as spoof detection
tasks. We also investigate the benefits of linear discriminant analy-
sis (LDA), widely used in speaker recognition, for the spoof detec-
tion task. Several experiments are performed using the speaker and
spoofing (SAS) database. For speaker verification, we compare the
performance of the proposed method with a baseline method of fus-
ing a conventional speaker verification system and a spoof detection
system. In these experiments, the proposed approach provides sub-
stantial improvements for spoof detection (relative improvements of
20% in EER over the baseline) as well as speaker verification under
spoofing conditions (relative improvements of 40% in EER over the
baseline).'
