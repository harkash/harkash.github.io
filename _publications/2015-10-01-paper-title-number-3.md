## Abstract
The performance of a speaker verification system is severely degraded by spoofing attacks generated 
from artificial speech synthesizers. Recently, several approaches have been proposed for classifying 
natural and synthetic speech (spoof detection) which can be used in conjunction with a speaker 
verification system. In this paper, we attempt to develop a joint modelling approach which can detect
the presence of spoofing attacks while also performing the speaker verification task. We propose a 
factor modelling approach where the spoof variability subspace and the speaker variability subspace 
are jointly trained. The lower dimensional projections in these subspaces are used for speaker 
verification as well as spoof detection tasks. We also investigate the benefits of linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA), widely used in speaker recognition, for the spoof detection task. 
Several experiments are performed using the speaker and spoofing (SAS) database. For speaker 
verification, we compare the performance of the proposed method with a baseline method of fusing 
a conventional speaker verification system and a spoof detection system. In these experiments, the 
proposed approach provides substantial improvements for spoof detection (relative improvements of 
20% in EER over the baseline) as well as speaker verification under
spoofing conditions (relative improvements of 40% in EER over the baseline).
