I am a first year PhD student with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at 
Georgia Institute of Techology, Atlanta. I am advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz) 
and [Prof. Irfan Essa](http://prof.irfanessa.com/).
I received my Master's degree in May 2019 from Georgia Tech, where my thesis studied the role of 
representations in  human activity recognition using wearables. I was advised by [Prof. 
Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz) 
and [Prof. David Anderson](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/david-v-anderson). 

Previously, I was associated with the [Learning and Extraction of Acoustic Patterns Labs](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/), 
[Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) where I worked on speaker verification and 
spoof detection, advised  by [Prof. Sriram Ganapathy](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/).
  
  
## Research

My research broadly involves learning representations for time-series data, with a special focus on 
developing techniques that require minimal supervision. I develop unsupervised and self-supervised 
learning algorithms for time series data such as audio, speech and sensory streams from 
wearables.
