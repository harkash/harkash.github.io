I am a first year PhD student with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Georgia Institute of Techology, Atlanta. I am advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz) and [Prof. Irfan Essa](http://prof.irfanessa.com/). My work broadly involves learning representations for time-series data and human activity recognition using wearables. Last year (from August 2018 -- May 2019), I did my Master's thesis advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz) and [Prof. David Anderson](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/david-v-anderson). My work involved developing unsupervised representations for human activity recognition using wearables.   

During the last summer, I worked as a Data Science Intern at Asurion and studied deep learning methods to rank photos by quality (aesthestics) and memorability. Previously, I was associated with the [Learning and Extraction of Acoustic Patterns Labs](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science where I worked on speaker verification and spoof detection.
