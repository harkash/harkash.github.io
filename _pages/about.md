I am a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Georgia Institute of Techology, Atlanta. Currently, I am doing a Master's thesis, advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz) and [Prof. David Anderson](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/david-v-anderson). My focus has been towards developing feature learning methods for bodyworn sensor based human activity recognition.  

During the last summer, I worked as a Data Science Intern at Asurion and developed deep learning systems to assist Experts with answering Customer questions in chat sessions. Previously, I was associated with the [Learning and Extraction of Acoustic Patterns Labs](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science where I worked on speaker verification and spoof detection.
