I am a final year PhD student with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at 
Georgia Institute of Techology, Atlanta. I am advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz) 
and [Prof. Irfan Essa](http://prof.irfanessa.com/).
I received my Master's degree in May 2019 from Georgia Tech, where my thesis studied the role of 
representations in  human activity recognition using wearables. I was advised by [Prof. 
Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz) 
and [Prof. David Anderson](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/david-v-anderson). 
I have been supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (through the AI-CARING Institute), Optum AI, and Google.

  
## Research

My research broadly involves learning representations for time-series data, with a special focus on 
developing techniques that require minimal supervision. I develop unsupervised and self-supervised 
learning algorithms for data from wearable sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes and intertial measurement units (IMUs).
Subsequently, I use such representations to analyse human behavior, through movements and activities.
