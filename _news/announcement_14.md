Based on our two Ubicomp tutorials on HAR, we release a new paper: [Past, Present, and Future of Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition using Wearables: A Surveying Tutorial on a Still Challenging Task](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14452) on ArXiv! It contains the history of HAR from heuristic-based features to the current trend of multimodal training, accompanied by a code walkthrough of standard self-supervised methods!
